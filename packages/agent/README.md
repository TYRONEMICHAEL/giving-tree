# Agent 

## Overview

The Agent Framework is designed to enable the development of agents with clearly defined capabilities for processing queries, managing data, and interfacing with various services. The framework emphasizes simplicity, modularity, and stateless operation, allowing for the creation of versatile agents suitable for a wide range of tasks.

## Defining Agent Capabilities

An essential step in creating an agent within this framework is defining its capabilities in a JSON file. This configuration not only guides the implementation of the agent's capabilities but also serves as a declarative description that can be consumed by other code or systems to understand what the agent does.

### JSON Configuration Structure

The JSON file should include the following key information about the agent:

- **`id`**: A unique identifier for the agent.
- **`name`**: A human-readable name for the agent.
- **`description`**: A detailed description of what the agent does and its purpose.
- **`version`**: The version of the agent, following semantic versioning.
- **`capabilities`**: An array of capabilities the agent possesses. Each capability is defined by:
  - **`name`**: The name of the capability.
  - **`description`**: A description of what the capability does.
  - **`parameters`**: An object defining the parameters the capability requires, including their types, descriptions, and any validation patterns.

### Example Capability

Below is an example of a capability defined in the JSON configuration:

```json
{
  "name": "addPrompt",
  "description": "Takes in a markdown string and separate metadata. The markdown should not include YAML front matter.",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "markdown": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "A markdown string for the prompt content."
      },
      "metadata": {
        "type": "object",
        "description": "Metadata for the markdown, including 'version', 'name', 'tags', and 'description'."
      }
    },
    "required": ["markdown", "metadata"]
  }
}
```

## Getting Started

To develop an agent within this framework:

1. **Define Capabilities**: Start by detailing the capabilities of your agent in a JSON file, as outlined above.
2. **Implement Agent Interface**: Use the defined capabilities as a guide to implement the `Agent<T>` interface, focusing on the `processQuery` function and data handling.
3. **Utilize JSON Configuration**: Ensure your agent's implementation aligns with the capabilities and parameters defined in the JSON configuration.
4. **Test and Refine**: Rigorously test your agent against various scenarios to ensure it behaves as expected according to the defined capabilities.

## Conclusion

The Agent Framework facilitates the creation of modular and flexible agents through a well-defined process of capability specification using JSON configurations. By adhering to this structured approach, developers can build powerful agents capable of a wide range of functions, with clear documentation for consumers to understand their capabilities.

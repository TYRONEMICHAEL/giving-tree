For the `core` package, the README.md should provide an overview of the fundamental interfaces and types that form the backbone of the agent and store functionalities within your framework. Here's a concise README.md tailored for the `core` package:
# Core

## Overview

The Core Package serves as the foundational layer of our framework, defining essential interfaces and types that underpin the functionality of agents and stores. It establishes a standardized structure for agents to process queries, handle data, and interact with stores, facilitating the development of modular, interoperable components.

## Key Components

### Agent Types and Interfaces

The Core Package defines a set of types and interfaces essential for creating agents:

- **`AgentId`**: A unique identifier for each agent.
- **`CapabilityParameter`**: Describes individual parameters for agent capabilities, including type, description, and optional validation patterns.
- **`CapabilitySchema`**: Outlines the schema for a capability, detailing its name, description, and required parameters.
- **`AgentMetadata`**: Contains metadata for an agent, including its ID, name, description, version, and a list of its capabilities.
- **`Agent<T>`**: The main agent interface, encapsulating a data store, metadata, and a method for processing queries.
- **`AgentError`**: An error type extending the standard `Error`, including additional context like `AgentId` and `CapabilitySchema`.
- **`createAgent`**: A utility function for instantiating agents, given metadata, a store, and a query processing function.

### Store Types and Interfaces

The Core Package also specifies interfaces and types for data stores:

- **`DocumentId`**: A unique identifier for documents within a store.
- **`Document<M>`**: Represents a document, including its text and metadata.
- **`Search<M>` and `SearchMetadata<M>`**: Define the structure for search queries and metadata-based searches.
- **`SearchResult<M>`**: Outlines the structure of a search result, including the document and its search score.
- **`Filter<M>`**: A union type representing different filtering conditions, including simple matches, ranges, and composite filters.
- **`Store<M>`**: The main store interface, detailing methods for document insertion, searching, updating, and removal.

### Orchestrator Overview (Upcoming)

Although not yet implemented, the orchestrator will play a crucial role in coordinating agents. It will:

- Accept a list of agents and determine the optimal one to process a given query, using advanced decision-making strategies such as Theory of Mind and a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for planning.
- Devise execution plans for queries, deciding on parallel or sequential agent invocation and synthesizing results to provide comprehensive responses.

## Getting Started

To utilize the Core Package in developing agents or stores:

1. **Familiarize with Core Types**: Understand the predefined types and interfaces, which are central to defining agents and stores.
2. **Define Agent Capabilities**: Use `CapabilitySchema` to detail what your agent can do and `AgentMetadata` to describe its properties.
3. **Implement Agent and Store Interfaces**: Build your agents and stores adhering to the `Agent<T>` and `Store<M>` interfaces, respectively.
4. **Utilize Utility Functions**: Leverage functions like `createAgent` to streamline agent instantiation.

## Conclusion

The Core Package provides the essential building blocks for creating sophisticated agents and stores within our framework. By adhering to its interfaces and types, developers can build modular, efficient, and interoperable components, paving the way for the upcoming orchestrator's intelligent query processing and execution planning capabilities.

Your plan for today is well-structured and covers a comprehensive set of tasks to enhance the functionality of your agent-based system. Here's a breakdown of how you can approach each task:

### 1. Create a Base Agent in the Core Package

- **Goal**: To create a base agent class that uses metadata to construct an engaging introduction for specialized agents.
- **Approach**: 
  - Implement a base agent class in your core package. This class should accept metadata as input and use Handlebars to compile this metadata with a predefined template.
  - The template should focus on showcasing the agent's capabilities in an engaging manner, rather than just listing them. Include examples or scenarios where the agent can be particularly useful.
  - Ensure the base agent class is extendable so specialized agents can inherit from it and provide their unique metadata.

### 2. Update Prompts Agent Metadata and Cleanup Code

- **Goal**: To refine the prompts agent by leveraging metadata for schema definitions and cleaning up the code.
- **Approach**:
  - Revise the `metadata.json` for the prompts agent to include all necessary details and schemas for each capability.
  - Refactor the prompts agent code to use this metadata for validating inputs instead of hardcoded schemas.
  - Ensure the agent code is clean, well-documented, and follows best practices.

### 3. Update the Store with Vector Database Implementation

- **Goal**: To finalize the implementation of the store API, integrating the vector database.
- **Approach**:
  - Complete any remaining tasks to fully integrate the vector database with your store API.
  - Test the store extensively to ensure it can handle all CRUD operations efficiently and integrates well with your agents.

### 4. Implement `listAllPrompts` in the Prompts Agent

- **Goal**: To add functionality in the prompts agent for retrieving all prompts from the store.
- **Approach**:
  - Implement the `listAllPrompts` function within the prompts agent. This function should query the store to retrieve all stored prompts and format them for presentation.
  - Consider pagination or filtering options if the number of prompts is large.

  - remove getting a single prompt. 

### 5. Deploy the Agent Locally and Interact with Custom GPT

- **Goal**: To deploy the agent locally using tools like ngrok or localtunnel and interact with it through a Custom GPT.
- **Approach**:
  - Use ngrok or localtunnel to expose your local development server to the internet.
  - Connect your deployed agent with a Custom GPT session. You might need to configure the GPT to understand how to interact with your agent's API.
  - Derive use cases that represent typical user interactions and write integration tests to validate these scenarios.
  - Interact with the agent through Custom GPT to manually test the user experience and adjust as needed.

For each task, ensure you have proper logging and error handling in place. After completing these tasks, you'll have a robust agent system with a well-defined store, engaging user interactions, and thorough testing.

### 5. Add Langfuse

Add instrumentation, analytics, and metrics

That's a solid TODO list to enhance and operationalize your Article Agent. Here's a breakdown of each task with some guidance:

### 1. Deploy the API using Docker
- **Task**: Package your API application into a Docker container for easy deployment.
- **Steps**:
  1. Create a `Dockerfile` in your project root.
     ```
     # Example Dockerfile
     FROM node:14
     WORKDIR /app
     COPY package*.json ./
     RUN npm install
     COPY . .
     EXPOSE 3000
     CMD ["node", "index.js"]  # Replace 'index.js' with your entry file
     ```
  2. Build your Docker image: `docker build -t article-agent-api .`
  3. Run your Docker container: `docker run -p 3000:3000 article-agent-api`

### 2. Adding Logging Using Pino
- **Task**: Integrate Pino for efficient logging within your application.
- **Steps**:
  1. Install Pino: `npm install pino`
  2. Set up Pino in your application:
     ```javascript
     const pino = require('pino');
     const logger = pino();
     logger.info('This is an info log');
     ```

### 3. Accessing Docker Logs
- **Task**: Learn how to access and download logs from your Docker container.
- **Steps**:
  1. To view logs for a running container: `docker logs <container_id>`
  2. To download logs, you can redirect the output to a file: `docker logs <container_id> > logs.txt`

### 4. Sign Up for Qdrant
- **Task**: Create an account with Qdrant to use their vector database services for storing your documents.
- **Steps**:
  1. Visit the [Qdrant website](https://qdrant.tech/) and sign up for an account.
  2. Follow their getting started guide to set up your vector database.

### 5. Define Shortcuts for the Agent
- **Task**: Create a set of shortcuts to streamline interactions with your agent.
- **Steps**:
  1. Identify frequent tasks or commands.
  2. Implement these shortcuts in your application logic for easy access.

### 6. Add Agent Prompt Templates Using Handlebars
- **Task**: Utilize Handlebars to create dynamic prompt templates for your agent.
- **Steps**:
  1. Install Handlebars: `npm install handlebars`
  2. Define your templates and use Handlebars to compile them with dynamic data.

### 7. Cleanup Agent Code
- **Task**: Refactor your agent code to eliminate redundancy and possibly integrate common functionalities into the core package.
- **Steps**:
  1. Identify common patterns or code blocks across your agents.
  2. Refactor these into reusable functions or modules within the core package.
  3. Replace the redundant code in your agents with these core functionalities.

**Journal Entry: February 01, 2024**

- **Feeling of Restlessness**: The day began with a sense of laziness and distraction amidst the household chaos, with the kids' screams and Bella's demands for attention overwhelming me.

- **Need for Escape**: Felt a strong desire to break free from the week's routine and explore something new, leading me to the nearby rolling hill known for its spectacular views.

- **Nostalgia for Storms**: The cool, turning weather reminded me of Johannesburg's intense storms, stirring a longing not for the city itself but for the tranquility and beauty of nature.

- **Epiphany During the Run**: The challenging run up the 12-degree incline hill sparked a realization about what I truly desire in life: a serene house atop a hill, where I can cherish time with my family away from the public eye, yet close enough to civilization.

- **Observations and Aspirations**: Encountered a man with his children who seemed to embody the certainty and contentment I yearn for—a life appreciating the finer things beyond societal validation, like a Porsche for the sheer love of beauty, not status.

- **Reflection on Success and Lifestyle**: This experience led to a deeper reflection on life's goals. It's not just about solving complex problems or career achievements but about envisioning a lifestyle that prioritizes family, nature, and personal fulfillment.

- **Ideal Setting**: Concluded that the essence of life is about finding that perfect spot on the hill, where the climate is just right, the skies are vast and dramatic, and solitude allows for a focus on what truly matters—family and personal peace.

**Reflection**: Today's run was more than just physical exercise; it was a journey towards clarity about my life's desires. The tranquility of the hill and the interaction with the man and his children served as a catalyst for reevaluating my aspirations. It's evident now that my ultimate goal is to create a harmonious life that balances the beauty of nature, family closeness, and personal satisfaction, away from the demands and judgments of the outside world. This vision will guide my future choices and efforts, aiming for a life that's fulfilling both personally and for my family.

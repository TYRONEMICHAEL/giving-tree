# The Giving Tree Project README

## Overview

The Giving Tree is a comprehensive framework designed to augment human-AI interactions, particularly with Large Language Models (LLMs), by providing sophisticated tools for managing, retrieving, and utilizing information. It aims to extend users' cognitive capabilities, offering a seamless and intuitive platform for knowledge management and AI-enhanced decision-making.

## Key Features

The Giving Tree offers a suite of features aimed at enhancing user engagement with AI systems, improving information management, and fostering personal growth:

1. **Portable Context**: Organizes and stores user contexts in an accessible format, coupled with advanced search capabilities.
2. **Frictionless Note Management**: Simplifies the storage and organization of notes for quick retrieval and utilization in AI interactions.
3. **Enhanced AI Interactions**: Utilizes Few-Shot Prompting and Theory of Mind to refine AI responses, making them more context-aware and relevant.
4. **Organized Knowledge**: Serves as a centralized platform for knowledge management, streamlining the organization and retrieval of information.
5. **Self-Development Incentives**: Encourages structured journaling and note-taking to support personal and professional growth.
6. **Creativity and Memory Support**: Aids in creative processes and idea development by offloading rote memory tasks to the platform.
7. **Insightful Reflections**: Enables users to review past entries, gaining insights into personal patterns and knowledge development.
8. **User Autonomy and Data Privacy**: Ensures user control over data, emphasizing privacy and autonomy in information management.

## Modules

The Giving Tree project is structured into several key modules or packages, each contributing to the framework's capabilities:

### Core Package

Defines foundational interfaces and types for agents and stores, providing a standard structure for data handling, agent capabilities, and interaction patterns within the framework.

### Agent Framework

Outlines the architecture for creating versatile agents capable of processing queries, interfacing with various tools and services, and synthesizing information to facilitate intelligent interactions between users and AI systems.

### Store Package

Provides a generic interface for data storage and retrieval, supporting vectorized search capabilities and metadata-driven data management, ensuring efficient and relevant access to stored knowledge.

## Orchestrator (Upcoming)

An upcoming component that will coordinate between different agents, utilizing advanced decision-making strategies to optimize query processing and execution, further enhancing the interaction with AI systems.
